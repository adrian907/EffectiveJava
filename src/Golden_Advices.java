#27
Casting is fragile with generics.


#33
Don't use ordinal() for indexing array!

#34
We can't create extensible enums, thats's why we create and implement interfaces allowing emulating
such functionality.


#35
Use annotations instead of naming patterns.

#36
Use @Override annotation to prevent hard to find bugs on EVERY method you try to override.(even from interfaces)

#37
Marker interfaces should be used for marking interfaces and classes, marker annotations for every other situation.
