By using a standard library, you take advantage of the knowledge of the experts who wrote it and the
experience of those who used it before you.

Another advantage of using standard libraries is that their performance tends to
improve over time, with no effort on your part. Many of the
Java platform libraries have been rewritten over the years, sometimes repeatedly,
resulting in dramatic performance improvements.

Libraries also tend to gain new functionality over time. If a library is missing
something, the developer community will make it known, and the missing functionality
may get added to a subsequent release.

A final advantage of using the standard libraries is that you place your code in
the mainstream. Such code is more easily readable, maintainable, and reusable by
the multitude of developers.

Every programmer should be familiar with the contents of java.lang, java.util,
and, to a lesser extent, java.io. Knowledge of other libraries can be acquired on an as-needed basis.

In the 1.2 release, a Collections Framework was added to the java.util package.

In release 1.5, a set of concurrency utilities was added, in the package
java.util.concurrent.
